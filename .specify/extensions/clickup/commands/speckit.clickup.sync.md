# ClickUp Sync — Sync

Make the feature's ClickUp representation match the committed repo: one feature-card in the
shared list, a subtask per user story (with dependency links and a markdown checkbox list of
its task lines), a verbose description body, and a derived status. **One-way** (repo →
ClickUp), **idempotent** (a no-op run makes zero ClickUp writes), **MCP-only**. The card
materializes as soon as `spec.md` exists and is enriched on every run.

## Preconditions

- The ClickUp MCP server is connected.
- ClickUp sync is not disabled for this repo. If `.specify/extensions/clickup-sync/config.yml`
  has `enabled: false` (the user previously declined), **silently do nothing and exit 0** — do
  not ask, do not sync. (Matches provision's decline state.)
- The manifest has `listId` and `statusMapping`. If not, **refuse** and instruct the user to
  run `/speckit-clickup-provision` first — do NOT create the list or guess a mapping here.
  Check with:

  ```bash
  .specify/extensions/clickup-sync/scripts/bash/clickup-manifest.sh get listId
  .specify/extensions/clickup-sync/scripts/bash/clickup-manifest.sh get statusMapping
  ```
- `spec.md` exists for the feature (the card is keyed off the spec).

## Derive (repo-side, no MCP)

Run the helpers to compute the desired state:

```bash
# US-grouped task lines with done-state (empty groups if no tasks.md yet):
.specify/extensions/clickup-sync/scripts/bash/clickup-parse-tasks.sh
# Derived status (not-started | in-progress | done):
.specify/extensions/clickup-sync/scripts/bash/clickup-derive-status.sh
```

Then compute each element's desired content:

- **Card body** (verbose, bounded): a short spec summary, the list of user stories with their
  priorities, and links/pointers to the artifacts that exist (spec/research/plan/tasks) — NOT
  their full contents.
- **Per user story**: a US-subtask whose markdown description is the story's title/why plus a
  `- [ ] T00x …` / `- [x] T00x …` checkbox list of that story's task lines (boxes reflecting
  `done`). Task lines with no user story (the `unattributed` group) go into a checkbox list in
  the **feature-card's own** description, not a subtask.
- **US dependency edges**: from the **spec's user-story numbering/priority order** (US2
  waits_on US1, US3 waits_on US1+US2, …) — NOT tasks.md phase order.
- **Card status**: the feature-wide derived value (`clickup-derive-status.sh` over the whole
  feature), written via `statusMapping`.
- **Per-US-subtask status**: EACH US-subtask also gets its own status, from that story's own
  task completion — `clickup-derive-status.sh --us <US#>` (all its tasks checked → done; some →
  in-progress; none → not-started) — mapped via `statusMapping` and re-computed every run
  (FR-009a). A subtask's status reflects its own progress, not the card's.

Hash each element with a **canonical, reproducible serialization** (hash the derived repo-side
data, NOT the rendered ClickUp prose — so any future run recomputes the identical hash and a
no-op stays a no-op):

```bash
.specify/extensions/clickup-sync/scripts/bash/clickup-manifest.sh hash --string "<content>"
```

Canonical content per element (keep this exact — the stored manifest hashes depend on it):

- **Card**: `status=<feature-derived-status>;feature=<feature-dir-name>`
- **US-subtask**: `us=<US#>;status=<per-us-derived-status>;items=<compact-json of that story's parse-tasks items array>`

where the items array is `clickup-parse-tasks.sh` output filtered to that story
(`.groups[] | select(.us==$u) | .items`, compact). Because these derive purely from repo state,
re-running with no repo change yields identical hashes → every element skips (SC-002).

## Diff and apply (toward the repo — one-way)

Compare each freshly-derived hash to the manifest (`get-card`, `get-us <US>`). For each
element: **unchanged** (hash equal) → skip, no MCP call; **new** → create; **changed** → update.
The repo is authoritative: whatever the derived content says overwrites ClickUp. A hand-edit in
ClickUp to an owned element is reverted on the next sync (never merged back into the repo).

1. **Feature-card**:
   - No `card.id` in manifest → `clickup_create_task` in `listId` with `name` = feature title,
     `markdown_description` = card body, `status` = `statusMapping[derived]`. Record via
     `clickup-manifest.sh set-card --id <id> --hash <hash>`.
   - Have `card.id`, hash changed → `clickup_update_task` (name/description/status). Refresh hash.
   - Have `card.id` but `clickup_get_task` 404s (deleted in UI) → recreate and refresh the id.
2. **US-subtasks** (one per user story):
   - No recorded id → `clickup_create_task` with `parent` = card id, `name` = `US# - <title>`,
     `markdown_description` = the story body + checkbox list, `status` = the subtask's own
     derived status via `statusMapping`. Record via `set-us`.
   - Recorded, hash changed → `clickup_update_task` (description and/or its own status). Refresh hash.
   - Recorded but missing in ClickUp → recreate under the card, refresh id.
3. **Dependencies**: reconcile each US-subtask's `waiting_on` edges to match the derived set —
   `clickup_add_task_dependency` (type `waiting_on`) for new edges, `clickup_remove_task_dependency`
   for edges no longer implied. No stale links remain.
4. **Status**: set the card's feature-wide status and each US-subtask's own per-story status via
   `clickup_update_task` using `statusMapping`; only write an element whose mapped status changed.

## Progressive materialization & edge cases

- **Spec but no tasks yet**: still create the card (body + status) and the US-subtasks; add no
  checkbox list (an absent/empty `tasks.md` is not an absent spec — do not create empty-checklist
  noise).
- **Task line removed**: because each US-subtask's checkbox section is rewritten wholesale from
  the derived content, a line dropped from `tasks.md` simply disappears — no residual boxes.
- **User story removed / renumbered** (a manifest US with no matching story now): **v1 default —
  report it in the run summary and leave the orphaned US-subtask in place (do NOT delete)**;
  re-point dependency edges so nothing dangles.
- **Shared list holds unrelated cards**: only ever touch cards/subtasks recorded in this
  feature's manifest; never modify or count anything else in the list.

## Report

Print a per-run summary: card created/updated/unchanged; US-subtasks added/updated/orphaned;
checkbox items added/flipped/removed; dependencies set/removed; status set.

## Never

- Never modifies `tasks.md` or any repo artifact based on ClickUp state (one-way).
- Never deletes a whole tracked feature-card for a removed feature (v1).
- Never sets lifecycle/human statuses beyond not-started / in-progress / done (deferred to the
  backlog feature).
- Never re-scans the whole list for dedup — the manifest is the index.
